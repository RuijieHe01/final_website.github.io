# **Motivation**

> AIDS, or Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, remains a significant global health challenge, with millions affected by HIV[1]. Effective treatment strategies are crucial for improving the quality of life of patients and prolonging survival[2]. Our analysis seeks to leverage this rich dataset to gain insights into factors influencing survival outcomes in AIDS patients and to evaluate the efficacy of different treatment modalities.
