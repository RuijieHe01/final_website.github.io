# **Motivation**

> AIDS, or Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, remains a significant global health challenge, with millions affected by HIV[1]. Effective treatment strategies are crucial for improving the quality of life of patients and prolonging survival[2]. Our analysis seeks to leverage this rich dataset to gain insights into factors influencing survival outcomes in AIDS patients and to evaluate the efficacy of different treatment modalities.

# **Project Directory**

* [Introduction](Introduction.html): A fully introduction of the background and data source of our survival analysis is given. We also state our motivation on why chose to conduct this study.

* [Data](Data.html): This section has included the description of the data we have used in this study. We drew the hist plots to check which covariates should be considered in our further exploration. 

* [Survival analysis](survival-analysis.html): In this section, we performed survival analysis. The life table is included which provides interval-based survival summaries, while Kaplan-Meier curves, log-rank tests, and the Cox proportional hazards model assessed survival dynamics.

* [Method](Method.html): In this section, we include our method on conducting the exploratory data analysis, multiple non-parametric and semi-pararmetric models to identify effective covariates when building survival functions. Rselevant tests are applied to prove the validity of our methods.

* [Shiny](https://mingzhicumc.shinyapps.io/shiny_dashboard_template/): In this section, we made our Kaplan-Meier Survival Estimate Shiny graph.

* [Report](Report.html): In this section, we include all our analysis and conclusion into a complete and comprehensive report.
