<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Report: Impact of Treatment Strategies in
AIDS patients</h1>

</div>


 
<div id="introduction" class="section level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) poses a persistent and
formidable global health challenge, affecting millions worldwide with
the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The quest for effective
treatment strategies is paramount, not only to ameliorate patients’
quality of life but also to prolong their survival . In this context,
our investigation is centered on harnessing insights from the AIDS
Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) Study 175 dataset . This dataset, arising
from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, meticulously
compares various treatment modalities. Specifically, it juxtaposes
monotherapy with zidovudine or didanosine against combination therapies
involving zidovudine, didanosine, and zalcitabine. The study cohort
comprises adults infected with HIV-1, exhibiting CD4 cell counts between
200 and 500 per cubic millimeter. The primary study endpoints, including
a substantial decline in CD4 cell count, progression to AIDS, or death,
provide a comprehensive basis for our survival analysis. Employing life
tables, Kaplan-Meier survival curves, log-rank tests, and the Cox
proportional hazards model , our analytical approach aims to unravel the
intricate web of factors influencing survival outcomes in AIDS patients.
Through meticulous data processing and exploratory data analysis (EDA),
we endeavor to not only describe survival trends over time intervals but
also to rigorously evaluate the efficacy of distinct treatment regimens.
Thus, our commitment extends to integrating advanced statistical
techniques, ensuring a nuanced and comprehensive understanding of the
dataset’s implications. This research, therefore, stands poised to
contribute substantively to the ongoing pursuit of effective
interventions in the realm of AIDS treatment.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-selection" class="section level1">
<h1>Data Selection</h1>
<p>To get a idea of some of the factors that affect treatment of AIDs,
we looked at a dataset published in 1996 by the AIDs Clinical Trials
Group. The study where these data were collected compared 4 different
AIDs treatments, but additionally this dataset contains information on
21 other predictors of death due to AIDS for the 2,139 study
participants. The primary column of interest is <code>cid</code>
(censoring indicator), which indicates whether or not the person died
within the period of observation. A detailed description of the dataset
can be found in the <a
href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/890/aids+clinical+trials+group+study+175">UC
Irvine Machine Learning Repository</a>.</p>
<div id="factors-that-affect-death-due-to-aids" class="section level3">
<h3>Factors that Affect Death Due to AIDs</h3>
<p>Having a look at some of the categorical variables in the dataset,
most do seem to be related to death due to AIDs, which we can see by the
differing proportions of death between groups. The exceptions are
hemophilia and perhaps race, which have little or no difference between
groups. As we might expect, patients who had previously received some
type of treatment (Non-ZDV antiretroviral therapy pre-175, ZDV in the 30
days prior to 175, Antiretroviral History) had higher death rates than
those who had not, presumably because patients who had previously
received treatment and still met the study inclusion criteria were more
resistant to treatment. Also of note, is that just from this one plot we
can see that the “ZDV only” treatment performed worse than the other
three, which intuition is confirmed by the results of <a
href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8813038/">the original
study</a>.</p>

</div>
<div id="data-summary" class="section level2">
<h2>Data Summary</h2>
<p>This part analyzed the baseline characteristics of participants
enrolled in the AIDS Clinical Trials Group Study 175. The dataset
comprises a diverse range of variables, categorized into continuous and
categorical types, each offering insights into the participant profiles
and study conditions. See Table 1 and Table 2.</p>
<p><img src="fig/datasummary.png" /></p>
<p>The continuous variables include age, CD4 and CD8 counts at baseline
and 20 weeks, duration of pre-treatment antiretroviral therapy, time to
failure or censoring, and weight at baseline. Participants ranged in age
from 12 to 70 years, with a median age of 34 years. The median CD4 count
at baseline was 340, increasing slightly to 353 at 20 weeks. Similarly,
CD8 counts showed an increase from a median of 893 at baseline to 865 at
20 weeks. The participants had a varied duration of pre-treatment with
antiretroviral therapy, ranging from 0 to 2851 days. The median time to
failure or censoring was observed at 997 days. Weight varied widely
among participants, with a median of 74.39 kg.</p>
<p>The categorical variables offer insights into treatment types,
hemophilia status, sexual orientation, history of IV drug use, Karnofsky
score, prior antiretroviral therapy, race, gender, symptomatic
indicators, and treatment indicators. Treatment types were evenly
distributed among the four categories. A majority of participants did
not have hemophilia (1959 out of 2139), were engaged in
homosexual/bisexual activities (1414 out of 2139), and had no history of
IV drug use (1858 out of 2139). Most participants had a high Karnofsky
score of 100. The majority were also not on non-ZDV antiretroviral
therapy pre-study and had used ZDV prior to the study. The study
population was predominantly male (1771 out of 2139) and white (1522 out
of 2139). Regarding antiretroviral history, a significant proportion
were experienced in antiretroviral therapy. The majority of participants
were asymptomatic, and a large number were on treatments other than ZDV
only. The off-treatment indicator before 96±5 weeks showed a larger
number not going off treatment, and censoring was more common than
failure in the outcome variable.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="result" class="section level1">
<h1>Result</h1>
<div id="exploratory-data-analysis-findings" class="section level2">
<h2>Exploratory Data Analysis Findings</h2>
<p>In the exploratory data analysis of the clinical study, a thorough
examination of continuous and categorical variables was conducted to
assess the comparability of treatment groups within a randomized
controlled trial (RCT) framework. The heatmap analysis, comprising
scatter plots, histograms, and correlation coefficients, revealed a
successful randomization process, indicated by the similar distribution
shapes and spreads of continuous covariates like age, CD4 and CD8
counts, weight, and pre-treatment duration across four treatment
regimens. This uniformity ensures each group’s comparability at
baseline, crucial for evaluating treatment efficacy and safety. While
the CD4 and CD8 counts, key markers in HIV treatment, showed a
significant increase across treatments, suggesting effective immune
restoration, the analysis also revealed a notable exception in
multicollinearity, primarily between CD4 and CD8 counts. These findings
underscore the need to employ statistical techniques that address the
interdependency of these counts, ensuring accurate coefficient
estimation and maintaining the integrity of the analysis.</p>
<p>The exploration of categorical variables through bar charts further
affirmed the balanced distribution of key demographics and clinical
characteristics like hemophilia status, sexual orientation, and drug use
history across the treatment groups, reinforcing the effectiveness of
the randomization. The boxplot visualization highlighted the
relationship between various categorical variables and event time, a
critical endpoint in the study. While some variables like the Karnofsky
score and treatment type showed potential influences on event timing,
others exhibited less variability, indicating a minimal impact.</p>
</div>
<div id="life-table" class="section level2">
<h2>Life table</h2>
<p>The life tables stratified by the treatment groups provided each
100-day interval-specific survival information for patients receiving
different AIDS treatments over time. Across all groups, they began with
a survival probability of 100%. The hazard rate followed a pattern of
increase until the 800 to 900-day interval, after which it showed a
decline at different rates, and we need to perform further test to
convince this difference. The median survival times were not attainable
as the survival probability did not reach 50% within the study time for
any group. Considering the 80% survival time instead, Treatment Group
0(ZDV only) showed the earliest time with 600-700 days, Treatment Group
3(ddI only) displayed intermediate time with 900-1000, and Treatment
Group 1(ZDV + ddI) and 2(ZDV + Zal) showed latest time with 1000-1100
days.</p>
</div>
<div id="non-parametric-survival-estimate" class="section level2">
<h2>Non-parametric Survival Estimate</h2>
<p>We utilized the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Nelson-Aalen
Estimator with 95% confidence interval to estimate the survival
probabilities for different treatment groups over time which extended up
to 1250 days, displayed in Figure 1. According to the result of
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, we observed that the magnitude of the
differences between the curves varies over time. Initially, the curves
start close together, indicating similar survival probabilities across
all groups. However, as time progresses, the curves diverge, with
Treatment Group for ZDV + ddI consistently showing the highest survival
probability and Treatment Group for ZDV only showing the lowest. The
curves for Treatment Groups for ZDV + Zal and ddI only display
intermediate survival probabilities, with Group ZDV + Zal generally
above Group ddI only. The Nelson-Aalen Estimator gives the same result.
The left table below is Log Rank Family of Test Result of Kaplan-Meier
estimate, the table on the right sight is about Nelson-Aalen.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="non-parametric-test" class="section level1">
<h1>Non-parametric test</h1>
<p><img src="fig/logrank.png" /></p>
<div id="log-rank-family-of-test" class="section level2">
<h2>1) Log rank family of test</h2>
<p>A series of log-rank family tests were conducted to compare survival
distributions across the four treatment groups in the study: ZDV only
(0), ZDV + ddI (1), ZDV + Zal (2), and ddI only (3). Under the null
hypothesis $ H_0: S_0(t) = S_1(t) = S_2(t) = S_3(t) $, where $ S_i(t) $
represents the survival function of the $ i^{th} $ treatment group at
time $ t $, the tests sought to detect any differences in survival
functions among the treatment groups.</p>
<p>As Table 3 shows, the results from the Log-rank (Mantel-Cox),
Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon, Tarone-Ware, Peto-Peto, and Modified Peto-Peto
tests all yielded highly significant $ p $-values below the 0.0001
threshold, firmly rejecting the null hypothesis at a conventional
significance level of 0.05. This indicates that there are statistically
significant differences in the survival functions across the treatment
groups.</p>
<p>The Fleming-Harrington family of tests, which gives different weights
to events at different times, also supported the rejection of the null
hypothesis for most configurations of $ p $ and $ q $ parameters.
However, for the FH test with $ p=0.5 $ and $ q=2 $, the $ p $-value was
0.0277046, which is above the more stringent significance level of 0.01
but still indicates significant differences at the 0.05 level.</p>
</div>
<div id="trend-log-rank-test" class="section level2">
<h2>2) Trend log rank test</h2>
<p>A weighted log-rank family trend test was applied to assess the
survival functions across four treatment groups, informed by the initial
findings from Kaplan-Meier estimations. The Kaplan-Meier curves
suggested a notably lower survival probability for the treatment group 0
(ZDV only) compared to the other groups, which exhibited similar
survival probabilities. Consequently, we state the null hypothesis <span
class="math display">\[H_0: S_0(t) = S_1(t) = S_2(t) = S_3(t)\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[H_1: S_0(t) \leq S_1(t) = S_2(t) =
S_3(t)\]</span></p>
<p>with weights (1,3,3,3) assigned to reflect the observed KM
trends.</p>
<p>As Table 4 shows, the Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test,
Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon test, and Tarone-Ware test all indicated
significant differences in survival experiences among the treatment
groups, with p-values well below the <span
class="math inline">\(0.0000001\)</span> threshold. The Peto-Peto and
Modified Peto-Peto tests substantiated these findings with similarly
significant p-values. Fleming-Harrington tests across various parameter
settings revealed significant trends, notably for <span
class="math inline">\(FH_p=0_q=1\)</span> (p = 0.0016029), indicating
significant differences at the <span class="math inline">\(0.05\)</span>
significance level. The results were consistent for other parameter
configurations, with the exception of <span
class="math inline">\(FH_p=0.5_q=2\)</span>, which presented a p-value
of 0.0380918, signifying a weaker trend that is significant at the <span
class="math inline">\(0.05\)</span> level but not at the more stringent
<span class="math inline">\(0.01\)</span> level.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="cox-ph-model" class="section level1">
<h1>Cox-PH model</h1>
<p>Based on the three different step selection directions, three models
are generated. The models used backward selection and bidirection
selection generated the same model, variables selected as statistically
significant at the 0.05 alpha level are trt1(ZDV+ddI), trt2(ZDV+Zal),
trt3(ddI), age, drugs1(history of IV drug use), karnof, preanti,
symptom1, offtrt1, cd40(cd4 at baseline), cd420(CD4 at 20 +/- 5 weeks),
and cd820(CD8 at 20 +/- 5 weeks). The model used forward selection
selected variables that are statistically significant at the 0.05 alpha
level also includes the same variables, however it includes much more
variables that are not statistically significant at the 0.05 alpha level
in the final model. Since the models produced by bidirection and forward
selection has the lowest AIC, and it is also simpler, it is being
selected as our final Cox-PH model for further discussion. The point
estimate and confidence interval for each significant variables are
shown in the code output figure. In this specific case, For the function

<div id="disscussion" class="section level1">
<h1>Disscussion</h1>
<p>Upon delving into survival data, we employed several life tables to
provide a comprehensive overview of the overall health status within our
sample. It is noteworthy that individuals frequently confront multiple
diseases simultaneously, introducing the concept of comorbidity.
However, life tables have inherent limitations, assuming a constant
mortality rate over time and overlooking factors such as immigration and
emigration, thereby impacting their predictive accuracy. This limitation
is underscored by JSTOR, which notes that life tables are often
constrained to specific end events, potentially resulting in a swift
decline in reported rates.</p>
<p>In the domain of survival analysis, parametric models encounter
challenges due to assumptions about survival time distribution,
potentially leading to inaccuracies in real-world scenarios. Conversely,
non-parametric models, as discussed in a pertinent article , offer
flexibility by abstaining from distributional assumptions. However, they
present their own challenges, including high variance and a requirement
for a sizable sample size.</p>
<p>Despite the advantages of non-parametric models, as highlighted in
the mentioned article, they are not without limitations. The article
underscores their susceptibility to high variance and the need for a
substantial sample size, occasionally leading to situations where
misspecified parametric models outperform their non-parametric
counterparts. Additionally, the article notes that non-parametric
estimators are often limited in their application until the occurrence
of a specific event, potentially creating an impression of a rapid
decline in reported rates.</p>
<p>Our study focused on a population undergoing HIV treatment, aiming to
assess the differential impact of four treatment regimens on patient
survival. The primary outcome, time to event or censoring, was compared
across treatments using log-rank tests. The results revealed significant
differences in survival probabilities among the treatment groups,
indicating variability in treatment efficacy. Notably, consistently low
$ p $-values across log-rank tests underscored the presence of at least
one treatment group with a distinct survival function.</p>
<p>While the tests indicated significant differences, they did not
specify the exact nature or clinical relevance of these differences.
Further pairwise comparisons or post-hoc analyses are essential to
pinpoint specific treatment groups with differing survival outcomes.
Study limitations include unaccounted potential confounders in the
survival analysis and the assumption of proportional hazards, which may
not hold for all treatment comparisons. These limitations should be
considered when interpreting results, as they could influence survival
distributions and the robustness of conclusions.</p>
<p>In summary, the statistical evidence suggests varying treatment
effectiveness, emphasizing the need for individualized treatment
approaches based on patient characteristics and treatment response.
Motivated by Kaplan-Meier survival estimates, the study delved into the
observed trend, substantiating it through weighted log-rank tests. The
results confirmed the inferior survival function of the ZDV-only group,
prompting further inquiry into the mechanistic reasons behind these
differences and encouraging the exploration of tailored treatment
strategies. Future studies are warranted to validate these results in a
broader context.</p>
<p>Additionally, we explored model selections under the BIC criterion, a
more conservative approach to selecting effective covariates. In this
context, six covariates were obtained, with the variable ‘trt’ replaced
by ‘treat,’ having only two categories. Stratification K-M estimates and
other methods indicated slight differences among ZDV+ddl, ZDV+Zal, and
ddl-only groups. The fitting of the Weibull baseline function closely
resembled the non-parametric one. Despite the potential loss of
practical information with the BIC criterion, the forward-selected model
with the AIC criterion was retained for its practical applicability.</p>

<h1>Conclusions</h1>
<p>In conclusion, our investigation of the AIDS Clinical Trials Group
Study 175 dataset has provided a nuanced understanding of the factors
influencing survival outcomes in AIDS patients and has offered a
comprehensive assessment of treatment efficacy. The dynamic differences
unveiled through life tables and Kaplan-Meier analysis underscore the
notable superiority of the ZDV + Zal treatment group in terms of
survival. Rigorous comparisons using log-rank family tests confirmed
statistically significant variations in survival functions among
treatment groups, with the trend log-rank test further accentuating the
superior performance of ZDV + ddI and revealing the challenges
associated with ZDV-only treatment. The Cox proportional hazards model,
informed by a meticulous bidirectional selection process, identified
pivotal variables influencing survival duration, and the diagnostic
validation of proportional hazards assumption fortifies the robustness
of our chosen model. However, the detection of time-varying effects
through Schoenfeld tests underscores the importance of cautious
interpretation. While our study provides valuable insights into the
effectiveness of specific treatment combinations, particularly ZDV + ddI
and ZDV + Zal, further research is imperative to elucidate mechanistic
details and validate our findings on a broader scale. These efforts are
essential for advancing the development of more efficient AIDS treatment
approaches and, in turn, promoting public health initiatives.</p>
