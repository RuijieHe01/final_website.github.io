# Motivation

AIDS, or Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, remains a significant global health challenge, with millions affected by HIV[1]. Effective treatment strategies are crucial for improving the quality of life of patients and prolonging survival[2]. Our analysis seeks to leverage this rich dataset to gain insights into factors influencing survival outcomes in AIDS patients and to evaluate the efficacy of different treatment modalities.

Additionally, we think this project will allow us to combine skills learned in this class with skills from all our other classes, especially Biostatistical Methods, Principles of Epidemiology, and Survival Analysis.

# Main Questions

* What are some factors contributes to the difference of survival outcomes in AIDS patients?

# Background Information

......

# Anticipated Data Sources

The [AIDS Clinical Trials Group Study 175](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/890/aids+clinical+trials+group+study+175) dataset provides a comprehensive collection of healthcare statistics and categorical information about patients diagnosed with AIDS.
